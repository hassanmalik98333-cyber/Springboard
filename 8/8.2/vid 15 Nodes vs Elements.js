// everything in html is represented in the DOM as nodes (indcluiding comments, comments are not an element but is a node). evrything in the DOM is a node. 

// Every element is a node, but not every node is an element.

// you can look at the nodes by using .childNodes

// The space between lines is also considered a node.

// to get the text of an element do .textContent or .innerText

// the DOM is huge, if you come across something that you do not know, research it.

// so far have covered the bread and butter of manipulating the DOM, the rest are extra.
