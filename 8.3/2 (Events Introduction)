how to write JS code that reacts to different events(click, drag, hover. going to full screen mode, ect...).

DOM events are actions that occur in the browser. Can be user based or having to do with the browser like an image loading.

write code that respond to those events and iss executed when a particular even occurs.

visit the event reference page on MDN.

ex. user hitting arrow keys and things move in the page(like in a browser game). Another is new posts loading when scrolling. New results showing when typing on the search tab on a website. Hover evens, click events.
