// With DOM you can interact with css and HTML using JS(to create a functional website)

// DOM: Document object model

// really difficult(no impossible) to maipulate HTML on a webisite and make interactive webistes.

// when a web page is loaded, the browser generates the DOM for that specific page

// Connects all the individual elements on the HTML page into a structur called a tree(on the note pad)

// each part of the html is an object, for example the body of the html is an object is JS and the h1 is an object as well, that is nested iniside of the body.

// the DOM represents all of the content on a page using objects so that it is easy to read on JS instead of looking through a bunch of string.
