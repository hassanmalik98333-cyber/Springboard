// The document object represents the web page that has been loaded 
// it acts as the "starting point" for the access to the DOM

//!! THINGS THAT WE CAN DO WITH THE DOCUMENT OBJECT!!
// finding elements in the document(ex find me all elements that have a calss of highlight or find me all link tags)
//you can make new elements and update existing ones.
// being notified when events take place like clicks(mouse click, typing, etc) 
// you can find all the document methods and properties on MDC (Called Document) https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document

//to access the document, you have to go to the consoletab on the browser(clear it) and write document. By default the representation you get, looks like html.

// you can get the document in a better form(JS object for) by typeing in the console, console.dir(document). This way is more organized.

// there is a lot and you do not need to know the majority of it.
